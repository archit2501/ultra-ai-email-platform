"""
Spam Rescue Service - ULTRA EMAIL WARMUP SYSTEM V1.0

Service for automatically detecting and rescuing emails from spam folders.
When warmup emails land in spam, this service:
1. Detects the spam placement
2. Moves email to inbox
3. Marks as "Not Spam"
4. Optionally marks as important
5. Generates a positive reply

This is a critical feature for building sender reputation as it
signals to ESPs that the sender is legitimate.

Features:
- Automatic spam detection
- Inbox rescue with positive signals
- Reply generation for rescued emails
- Statistics tracking
- Alert generation for high spam rates
