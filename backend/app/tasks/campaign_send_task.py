Campaign Send Background Task

Handles asynchronous email sending for campaigns:
- Fetches campaign recipients
- Renders personalized templates
- Sends emails via SMTP with RATE LIMITING
- Tracks send progress and status
- Updates campaign metrics
- Handles failures gracefully
- Creates follow-up campaigns (if enabled)

2026 Best Practices Applied (from Instantly.ai Benchmark Report):
- Daily send limit: 50 emails/day max per domain
- Warmup period: 4-6 weeks gradual increase
- Send delay: Minimum 30 seconds between emails
- Business hours: 9 AM - 5 PM recipient timezone
- Follow-up limit: 3-5 maximum per recipient
